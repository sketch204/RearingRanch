# RearingRanch
Rearing Ranch is a small game me, Inal Gotov and my partner Tamir Arnesty are making for our final project in our programming class. It will be an educative game for kids from age 3-5 which will teach them basic color, classification of animals as well as simple arithmetics.

The theme of the game is based on a farm, where you must help a young cowboy manage his farm.
