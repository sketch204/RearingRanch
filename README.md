# RearingRanch
Rearing Ranch is an educational game my partner Tamir Arnesty and I, Inal Gotov, created for our final project in the
Computer Science A course. The game is desgined for children between the ages of 3-5 and is intended to teach them
to identify primary, secondary, and mixed colours, along with animals classification and basic arithmetic. This is done
through three intriguing and increasingly difficult stages, with three difficulty levels for each that you may
choose from.

The game is based on a young farm boy who needs help from his fellow young friends. Help this young cowboy manage
his farm in a fun and exciting way that will also teach you colours, animals, and math!
