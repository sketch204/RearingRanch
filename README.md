# RearingRanch
Rearing Ranch is a small game me, Inal Gotov and my partner Tamir Arnesty are making for our final project in our programming class. It will be an educative game for kids from age 3-5 which will teach them basic color, classification of animals as well as simple arithmetics.

The game is in a farming theme where you must help a young cowboy manage his farm.
