# RearingRanch
Rearing Ranch is a small gamemy partner Tamir Arnesty and I, Inal Gotov are 
making as our final project in our Computer Science A programming class. It will be an educative
game targetted for kids between the ages of 3 to 5, which will teach them basic colours, classification of 
animals as well as simple arithmetics.

The game has a farm theme where you must help a young cowboy manage his farm.
